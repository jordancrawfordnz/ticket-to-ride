# Ticket to Ride
A Ruby on Rails implementation of the Ticket to Ride board game.

Developed by Jordan Crawford during dev-train at [Powershop](http://powershop.com/). This is a way for me to learn Ruby, Rails, testing and object oriented design.

**Copyright 2017, Powershop NZ Ltd.** This is because it was developed during work hours at Powershop.
